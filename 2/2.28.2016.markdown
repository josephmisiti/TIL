##### You need to watch out what you eat depending on the day of the week in NYC

I am currently reading "Kitchen Confidenial" by Anthony Bourdaine and he insists the following:

* fish deliveries are Tuesday and Friday, so you never want to eat fish on Monday, as it is 4-5 days old
* say no to mussels, no matter way you are
* breat is recycled, so you should be ok with it
* if the bathroom is disgusting, the kitchen is probably disgusting -- dont eat there
* hollandaise is a giant bacteria trap - do not eat it
* brunches is old foot that they are trying to sell to avoid a total loss - avoid brunch
