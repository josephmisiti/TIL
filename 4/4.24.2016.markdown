#### Redux Concepts

1. Application State is maintained in single javascript object (global)

1. If a compenent wants change the state, he needs to dispatch an action, which is 
also a javascript object with one required property, `type`

1. Pure functions are deterministic. If you call them you know what the output will be, and they do 
not modify the input. They do not do non-deterministic things like update databases or require network connection.
Non-pure functions are the opposite of pure functions

1. To describe state mutations, you need to write a pure function that takes the 1) previous state of the application, 
2) the action that was dispatched, and returns the new state of the application. This function is the reducer and it has to
be pure.

```javascript
function someReducer(state, action) {
    return newState
}
```
