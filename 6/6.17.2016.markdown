##### DNA Transcription

Most human cells have a nuclear (eukaryotes) and inside this nuclear there are 23 chromosomes, each of which
contains long strands of DNA. Within DNA, there are genes and when a gene is "activated", a gene called RNA polymerase attaches to the
to the start of the gene. It moves along the DNA create a strand of messenger RNA uses free bases floating
inside the nucleus. (DNA code determines the order). 

##### Creation of Protein

MRNA needs to be processed before it can be turned into proteins. MRNA moves out of nucleus in cytoplasm where
ribosome (protein factories) binds to the RNA, reading the code and produces a chain of amino acids. Transfer 
RNA molecules carry the amino acid to the ribosome. They are read three bases at a time creating a chain of amino
acids

Once the last amino acid has been added, the chain folds and the protein is created!
